%---------------------------------------------------------
Software Engineer of three years with additional three years of experience in full-stack web development from freelance projects.

Professionally, I have been developing backends in Play Framework (Scala), Spring Boot (Kotlin) and Express/Koa (NodeJS). I have experience in developing and designing microservices and I also have experience in AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Docker and Kubernetes as I've been taking active responsibilities in DevOPS for several projects.

Spending two years at a software house enabled me to work on several different projects allowing me to get experienced with various technologies and every part of the software development cycle from design to deployment. I have been mainly focused on backend development but due to my freelance projects and personal interests, I am also fluent in ReactJS and it's ecosystem including but not limited to React-Router, Redux and GraphQL.

My current technology of choice is Scala, namely Play Framework. I am actively trying to develop a more functional style of programming.
